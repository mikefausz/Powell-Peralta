You Should Know

Challenge #1.1: Let's work on your layout skills! Recreate the web page from the mockup above. Place your HTML in a file called index.html, and your CSS in a file called styles.css. Any images you use should be placed in a images directory. You can choose your own images or crop them from the mockup in an image editor of your choice. 
Goal #1.1: Create the website as shown in the mockup image.

Adventure Mode
Challenge #2.1: Modify your existing page so that the design is responsive across a wide range of screens. How the page scales is up to you, but make sure that everything still works as intended even at small widths. Don't forget to update your Github with the responsive design!
Goal #2.1: Submit your updated Github URL below.
